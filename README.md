# Etch-A-Sketch
This will be my attempt at a "Etch-A-Sketch" app.

Not really sure how I am going to go about this but I look forward to learning.

Seems like this is going to require a bunch of divs!

Update: I wasnt able to figure everything out I wanted to do but it looks good.

I might revisit to see if I can make it so you can re-add the grid lines and only draw while the mouse button is down.
